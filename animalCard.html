        <p id="info">
          The Bengal tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian
          subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene. Today, it is threatened by
          poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at
          comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the
          Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large
          enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult
          individuals. The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with
          stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior
          parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings
